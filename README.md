# Note

So I did forget to push up my commits to this repo. However, all the code, assets, and even the project.godot file just, disappeared. I recreated as much of the project as I could, removing one juicy feature due to time constraints. I do not know why that occured, but I'll keep a closer eye on my projects just in case.
